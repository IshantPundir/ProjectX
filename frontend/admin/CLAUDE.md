# ProjectX — Frontend (Admin)
## Claude Code Context (Admin App)

> Read the root `CLAUDE.md` first. This file contains admin-app-specific rules that extend it.

## What This Surface Is

The **Admin App** is an internal tool for ProjectX operators. It is NOT client-facing. Its sole purpose is to provision new client tenants and monitor their status.

This is a minimal internal surface — not a product UI. It does not need the same level of polish as the Client App.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16.2.2 with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-first)
- **Auth:** @supabase/ssr v0.10 (email/password only)
- **HTTP client:** `apiFetch` wrapper in `lib/api/client.ts` — all calls go to Nexus
- **Hosting MVP:** Railway

## Current Functionality

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/login` | Email/password sign-in for ProjectX admins |
| `/signup` | New admin account creation → redirects to `/pending-approval` |
| `/pending-approval` | Waiting screen (admin approval is handled outside this app) |
| `/dashboard` | Lists all provisioned clients with invite/onboarding status |
| `/dashboard/provision` | Form to create a new client tenant and send Company Admin invite |

---

## Auth Pattern

**Route protection is enforced server-side via Next.js middleware.** The middleware handler lives in `frontend/admin/proxy.ts` (exported as `proxy`, matched by the `config.matcher` at the bottom of that file). On every non-static request it:

1. Calls `supabase.auth.getUser()` to cryptographically validate the session (also refreshes the token cookie if needed).
2. Redirects unauthenticated users away from any non-public route to `/login`.
3. Checks `user.app_metadata.is_projectx_admin`. Non-admin authenticated users are redirected to `/pending-approval`. Only admins reach `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/provision`.
4. Redirects already-authenticated users away from `/login` and `/signup`.

This means the unauthenticated admin shell is never rendered — the redirect happens before the React tree mounts.

The `is_projectx_admin: true` claim must be set in the admin user's Supabase `app_metadata` outside this app (via Supabase dashboard, CLI, or a backend provisioning script). The frontend does not grant or modify this flag.

## API Endpoints Used

| Method | Endpoint | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/clients` | Dashboard page |
| POST | `/api/admin/provision-client` | Provision page |

Both require `is_projectx_admin` JWT claim.

**Available but not yet wired into the admin UI** — backend exposes the full tenant lifecycle:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/admin/clients/{id}/block` | Set `clients.blocked_at` (reversible) |
| POST | `/api/admin/clients/{id}/unblock` | Clear `clients.blocked_at` |
| DELETE | `/api/admin/clients/{id}` | Soft-delete (sets `clients.deleted_at` + cascades to users) |
| POST | `/api/admin/clients/{id}/hard-delete` | Hard-delete via PG cascade (audit history is preserved — see migration 0023) |

Wire these into the dashboard when tenant suspension / deletion lands as an admin task.

## Dev Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server (localhost:3001)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npx tsc --noEmit     # Type check (no dedicated script — package.json only ships dev/build/start/lint)
```

## Design Constraints

- No shared component library — all UI is inline within page files
- No Zustand, TanStack Query, or shadcn/ui — not needed for this surface
- Keep it simple — this is an internal tool, not a product
